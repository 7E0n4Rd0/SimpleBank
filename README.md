## About
simpleBank is my little project in Java that I used as a base a assignment that I did in I.T course, but the assignment was rather chaotic because in that period I was weak in Java and OOP. So, I'm remaking that assignment with my knowledge that I am developing while studying Java through a short course that I paid for on Udemy and reading the language documentation. Also, I remake the case study.

## Case Study
A bank requested a system that registers bank branch and customer data so that bank accounts can be created and operated.

The branch data is the branch code, bank name and address; the customer data to be registered is: customer CPF, customer name, customer telephone number; the bank account data will be: account number, customer name and balance.

When instantiating an account, it must start with the default balance as zero. Customer data will be registered only once, and there cannot be duplicate accounts. Although, 

In addition, there must be functions that format CPF, name, telephone number so that the data is stored in this format respectively: 123.456.789-12, John Marston, (11) 94002-8922 and functions that validate the CPF, bank account, name and telephone number. The CPF has eleven digits, two dots and a dash, and cannot be longer than this format and cannot be duplicated in the system; The bank account has the account number attribute, which is unique and unchangeable, and the access password.
The data from the bank branches and accounts must be stored in a “.csv” file, in which the program will read and load the registered branches and accounts, in order to compare them with the accounts and branches previously registered to avoid duplication. If this file does not exist, it will show that a file will be created to store the data. If it is deleted, it will show on the screen that it was not possible to find the file.
